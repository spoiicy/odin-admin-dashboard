# odin-admin-dashboard
This is an administrator dashboard which is part of theOdinProject curriculum.

1) Now I'm left with adding left inline border to main-content cards.
2) I was unable to use text-overflow:ellipsis on announcement cards like it has been done in some submissions.
3) seperation lines are pending in announcement card section
4) One more thing I would like to try would be to make the full content section hide under navbar when it is scrolled.

Although these above features are left to be integrated, I'm quite happy with my progress.
